Hello, I am totally new to working with websites and am lucky to have a web developer to help, 
however classicly things always go wrong at the weekend. The links from Solidus don't appear to work in CMS. 
Is there anyone that might be able to point me in the right direction? I have checked all the links, 
they all work when logged in, but not logged out. Really not sure what to do and don't have anyone to help! 
Would be so grateful! Thanks so much for any help!
